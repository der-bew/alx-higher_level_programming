# 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
## Requirements
### Python Scripts

   - Allowed editors: ```vi```,``` vim```,``` emacs```
   - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
   - All your files should end with a new line
   - The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
   - A ```README.md``` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
   - A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
   - Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
   - All your files must be executable
   - The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

### C Scripts

   - Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
   - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
   - All your files should end with a new line
   - Your code should use the ```Betty``` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
   - You are not allowed to use global variables
   - No more than 5 functions per file
   - In the following examples, the ```main.c``` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your r0x01-python-if_else_loops_functionsepo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our ```main.c``` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
   - The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called ```lists.h```
   - Don’t forget to push your header file
   - All your header files should be include guarded
